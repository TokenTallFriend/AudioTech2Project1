Ideas for the project:
  FM synthesis somehow
  I can code a LP filter using my final project from AT 1
  Delay ain't too hard


Pitch implementation:
  A big ol' list
    [['note1', length], ['note2', length]... ['rest', length]]
      'note' should be a string if a single note or a list filled with strings if a chord
